modern scroll is an up-to-date alternative to Opera's standard scrollbars.

What's awesome about modern scroll?

+ scrolling is sometimes faster then with Opera's standard bars!
+ its scroll bars don't take up any space so the whole screen width can be used to display what a browser is made for: websites
+ elements or whole pages don't shift by some pixels when content changes and bars become (un)necessary
+ scroll bars are usable in fullscreen mode as well
+ scroll bars automatically hide when they are not needed
+ unique "superbar" which makes it possible to scroll horizontally and vertically at the same time
+ optional buttons for scrolling to the top and bottom of the page
+ behavior and appearance is fully customizable
